# STM32F0XX_boost_converter
This repository contains the source code and project files for controlling a boost converter using an STM32F0XXX microcontroller.


The project leverages the STM32F0's peripherals, such as PWM, ADC, and timers, to regulate the output voltage of a DC-DC boost converter. I used **10 bits ADC read** for this project.

The STM32F0xxx series of microcontrollers, based on the ARM Cortex-M0 core, is well-suited for various embedded applications, including power electronics control systems like boost converters. A boost converter is a type of DC-DC converter that steps up (increases) the input voltage to a higher output voltage
